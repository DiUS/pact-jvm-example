Javascript pact consumer example
=====================================

There is no javascript pact library at the moment.  
We would be really happy if one of you node.js people wanted to build one

In the mean time this is a work around that will allow you to author and verify pacts between browser based javascript clients and service providers

It uses scala to author the pact using the DSL then selenium to drive a browser which triggers the javascript against the MockServiceProvider, then scala to verify and generate the pact file
